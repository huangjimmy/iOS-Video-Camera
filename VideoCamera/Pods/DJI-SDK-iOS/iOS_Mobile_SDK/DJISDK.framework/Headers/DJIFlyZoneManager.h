/**
 *  Fly Zone Manager gives information about nearby fly zones, and APIs to unlock

 *  zones possible:
 *   - `DJIFlyZoneTypeCircle`: Cylinder or truncated cone volume with four levels of
 *  restriction:
 *      - Warning Zones : no restriction
 *      - Enhanced warning zones : Flight restricted, can be unlocked for
 *          flight when the user logs into their DJI account
 *      - Authorization zones : Flight restricted, can be unlocked for
 *          flight when the user logs into their DJI account and the account
 *          has been authorized to unlock authorization zones.
 *      - Restricted zones : Flight restricted
 *  - `DJIFlyZoneTypePoly`: Fly zone that consists of one or more sub fly zones that
 *  are cylinders or complex volumes with different height limitations. A height
 *  limitation of 0 means flight is completely restricted. This is used by Spark,
 *  Mavic, Phantom 4 Series, Inspire 2 and Matrice 200 series.
 *  On the Phantom 3, Inspire 1, M100, M600, A3/N3 series of products, there can
 *  also be a buffer area with radius about 23 km around a restricted fly zone where
 *  flight height is limited to 120m.</br>
