/**
 *  DJI aircraft firmware require mobile applications that control DJI aircraft to
 *  be activated with the user's DJI account, if that application is being used in
 *  China. This will ensure operators use the correct set of geospatial information
 *  and flight functions for their aircraft, as determined by their geographical
 *  location and user profile.
 *   A summary of the activation system is:
 *   - Users in China are required to activate their application by logging into
 *  their DJI account at least once every three months within the application
 *   - Activation will be persistent in the application until the user logs out
 *   - A data connection will be required to log into a DJI account
 *   - Outside of China, the SDK will automatically activate the application without
 *  requiring the user to log in
 *   - Additionally, users in china are required to bind their aircraft to their
 *  user account in DJI Go. This is required only once.
 *   If an application is not activated, the aircraft not bound (if required), or a
 *  legacy version of the SDK (<4.1) is being used, all camera live streams will be
 *  disabled, and flight will be limited to a cylinder of 100m diameter and 30m
 *  height to ensure the aircraft stays within line of sight.
 *   This class is used to check the state of application activation and aircraft
 *  binding.
