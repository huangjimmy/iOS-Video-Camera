/**
 *  The AirSense state of an airplane.
 *  DJI AirSense only sends out warnings of nearby civil aircraft under certain
 *  circumstances; it will NOT control DJI aircraft to avoid other aircraft
 *  automatically. Make sure to fly with your aircraft within visual line of sight
 *  at all times, and always fly with caution. After receiving warnings, lower your
 *  aircraft to a safe height. In addition, DJI AirSense has the following
 *  limitations:
 *  1. DJI AirSense can only receive messages sent from civil aircraft equipped with
 *  an ADS-B out device under 1090ES (RTCA DO-260) or UAT (RTCA Do-282) standards.
 *  For civil aircraft without ADS-B outs or with malfunctioning ADS-B outs, DJI
 *  AirSense cannot receive related broadcasted messages or send out warnings.
 *  2. When there are obstacles in between a civil aircraft and DJI aircraft, DJI
 *  AirSense will fail to receive ADS-B messages sent from civil aircraft or to send
 *  out warnings.
 *  3. DJI AirSense may fail to receive ADS-B messages sent from civil aircraft or
 *  send out warnings due to ever changing circumstances and interference. It is
 *  highly recommended to fly with caution and stay aware of your surroundings
 *  during flight.
 *  4. DJI AirSense cannot send out warnings when the DJI aircraft cannot accurately
 *  determine its location.
 *  5. DJI AirSense cannot receive ADS-B messages sent from civil aircraft or send
 *  out warnings when it is disabled or misconfigured.
