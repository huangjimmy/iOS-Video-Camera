/**
 *  Abstract class for components in a DJI Product. A component can be a camera,
 *  gimbal, remote controller, etc. A DJI product consists of several components.
 *  All components of a product are subclasses of `DJIBaseComponent` and can be
 *  accessed directly from the product objects (`DJIAircraft` or `DJIHandheld`).

/**
 *  Returns the component index. Index is zero based. A component will have an index
 *  greater than zero when there  are multiple components of the same type on the
 *  DJI product, and one of the components already has the index 0.  For instance,
 *  M210 can have two gimbal mounted cameras, and will therefore have two gimbal
 *  components with indices  0 and 1, and two camera components with indices 0 and
 *  1. For Matrice 600, there are printed numbers on the battery  boxes. The
 *  `DJIBattery` component instance with index 0 corresponds to battery compartment
 *  number 1. For Inspire 2  and M200 series, `DJIBattery` with index 0 corresponds
 *  to the battery on the port (left hand) side of the aircraft.  For M210 and M210
 *  RTK, `DJICamera` and `DJIGimbal` with index 0 corresponds to the camera and
 *  gimbal on the port  (left hand) side of the aircraft.
