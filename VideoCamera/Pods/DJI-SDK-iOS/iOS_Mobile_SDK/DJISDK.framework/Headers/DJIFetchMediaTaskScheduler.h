/**
 *  The camera stores the media it captures to SD or SSD storage on the product.
 *  When the mobile device wants to access the media, it needs to download it from
 *  the product over the wireless link between the product, remote controller and
 *  mobile device (depending on the product). Each media file captured by the camera
 *  can have several types of content associated with it including the full
 *  resolution media content, a lower resolution preview, a lower resolution again
 *  thumbnail, and custom data within the file's XML meta data. The full resolution
 *  content can take a long time to download over the wireless link, so it is often
 *  useful to download previews or thumbnails of many media files, and then only
 *  download the full resolution content of fewer select media files. This scheduler
 *  conveniently allows the small content types of media files (preview, thumbnail
 *  and custom data) to be downloaded to the mobile device. The scheduler can be
 *  used to queue and download content from a series of files, as well as used to
 *  re-prioritize files during the download process. The scheduler holds a list of
 *  pending tasks and it completes them one by one in first-in-first-out order. To
 *  prioritize a new task, `moveTaskToNext` can be used. Each task relates to a
 *  media file and can download multiple content types sequentially. When the last
 *  content type of a task starts being downloaded, the task is removed from the
 *  list. Note, the scheduler cannot be used to queue the download of full
 *  resolution media content. Only `fetchFileDataWithOffset:updateQueue:updateBlock`
 *  can be used for this.
